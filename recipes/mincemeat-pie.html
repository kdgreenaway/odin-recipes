        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Step back in time with this traditional mincemeat pie, featuring a flavorful blend of fruits, spices, and a hint of brandy encased in a golden, flaky crust.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¼ pounds round steak, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup apple cider</li>
            <li>4 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and finely diced</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups dried currants</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups raisins</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) jar sour cherry preserves</li>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>½ pound chopped candied mixed fruit peel</li>
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) can pitted sour cherries, drained</li>
            <li>1 (14.1 ounce) package double-crust pie pastry, thawed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar, for sprinkling</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine steak and cider in a Dutch oven. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cover and cook until steak is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove steak to a cutting board; coarsely chop, then return to the pot.</li>
            <li>Stir in apples, currants, raisins, cherry preserves, 1 1/3 cups sugar, mixed fruit peel, and butter. Add ginger, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt. Simmer, uncovered, over low heat until mixture is very thick, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Stir in cherries and remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Transfer filling to a container and allow to cool at room temperature. Cover tightly and refrigerate for at least 1 week before using.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Line a 9-inch pie dish with 1 pastry crust. Spoon filling into crust and cover with second pastry crust. Crimp edges and cut several slits into top pastry. Brush with cream and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 45 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
