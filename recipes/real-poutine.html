        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Indulge in Canadaâ€™s classic comfort food with this authentic poutine recipe, combining crispy fries, rich brown gravy, and melty cheese curds for the perfect savory treat.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 (10.25 ounce) can beef gravy</li>
            <li>5 medium potatoes, cut into fries</li>
            <li>2 cups cheese curds</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
            <li>While the oil is heating, begin to warm gravy.</li>
            <li>Place fries into the hot oil, and cook until light brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Cook fries in batches if necessary to allow them room to move a little in the oil. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
            <li>Place fries on a serving platter, and sprinkle cheese over them.</li>
            <li>Ladle warmed gravy over the fries and cheese, and serve immediately.</li>
